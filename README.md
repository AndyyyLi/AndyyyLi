Hello! I'm Andy, a UBC undergraduate in Computer Science and Mathematics, and a current graduate student in UBC's Master of Management Dual Degree program.

I'm hoping to go into the video game industry, but I'm gradually opening my options as long as I enjoy what I do.

Learning about the programming world one step at a time.
